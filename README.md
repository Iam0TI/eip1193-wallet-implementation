# The Task:
You are to build a react application implementing injected wallet connection, with all necessary events handled.

The connection state, methods, and events should be managed in a custom hook. Use as many react hooks as possible

The application should have an input field for address, and should get and render the balance of the address, depending on the network you're connected to.
